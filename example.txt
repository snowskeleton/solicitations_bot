evp_description:  (The Emergency Response Training Center (ERTC) #2 Training/Drill Tower was built in 2004 and is located at 5906 Stanford Road in Jamestown, NC. It is an open structure, four floors tall, and is a total of 5,074 square feet of floor space. The building is made up of structural steel frame and stairs with concrete slab floors. The exterior of the building is structural concrete block independent of the steel structure. The steel structure needs to be cleaned of existing paint and rust, primed and painted. This will require selective demolition of the concrete block structure to get access to the structure where the steel members are bolted together at the corners of the structure. Once the painting is completed, the areas with new structural concrete block will require repair. Upon completion of the CMU repairs, the interior and exterior CMU surfaces are to receive a Direct Applied Finish System.  The existing handrail posts are corroding and will require modifications and repairs.  The concrete slab coating on the top floor/roof is also to be removed and a new coating system installed.)
